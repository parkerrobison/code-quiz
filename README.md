# code-quiz
 
## Purpose
A website that provides a student with the opportunity to quiz themselves on their knowledge about development principles. The student's score will be stored. 
 
The user will have a set amount of time to anser the questions that will be presented to them. Failure to complete the quiz in the alloted time will send the user back to the start screen, not permitting them to submit a high score. If they manage to answer all the questions before the time runs out they will be prompted to enter their initials to store their high score. Clicking the go back button will take them to the home page so they can attempt the quiz again. 

## Future improvements
-Initially, it was planned for their to be a function included that would clear the local storage data but it didn't work out. Including a working button on the page would be optimal. 
-Randomizing the questions would increase the dificulty of the quiz.
